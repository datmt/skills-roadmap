# AWS Networking Mastery Roadmap (Advanced Networking Specialty & Job Skills)

**Overview:** This multi-month plan (about 5 months, 20 weeks) balances **exam preparation** for the *AWS Certified Advanced Networking – Specialty* and **practical hands-on skills** for real-world AWS networking. Each week has specific study materials (heavy on AWS official docs, whitepapers, and labs) and hands-on exercises. Milestones at the end of each month help track progress. The plan assumes ~2 hours per week, so adjust if you can allocate more time. Regularly refer to the **AWS exam guide** and objectives to stay aligned, and be prepared to adjust the schedule based on your progress.

## Month 1: AWS Networking Foundations (Weeks 1–4)

**Goal:** Build a strong foundation in Amazon VPC core concepts, security controls, and basic connectivity. By month’s end, you should confidently design a basic VPC network with public/private subnets, secure it, and understand how AWS networking maps to OSI/TCP-IP concepts.

- **Week 1 – AWS VPC Basics & Setup:**  
  *Tasks:* Review the **AWS Certified Advanced Networking exam guide** to familiarize yourself with domains and key topics. Read the *Amazon VPC Getting Started* tutorial (AWS docs) to refresh VPC basics: VPCs, subnets, route tables, Internet Gateways (IGW), etc. Create a simple VPC from scratch (using the AWS Console or AWS CloudFormation sample) with one public and one private subnet. Launch a small EC2 instance in the public subnet and attach an **Internet Gateway** and proper route so you can SSH or HTTP into it. *Hands-on Lab:* Create another EC2 instance in the private subnet (no public IP). Set up a **bastion host** (or use the public instance as a jump box) to connect to the private instance, verifying private connectivity. Use Security Groups to allow the necessary SSH/ICMP.  
  *Milestone:* Able to explain and set up a basic VPC with public/private subnets and internet access. Confirm that you understand how route tables direct traffic (e.g., private subnet uses NAT or has no internet route), and how **security groups** and **network ACLs** differ in controlling traffic (stateful vs stateless). This solid foundation will be critical for advanced topics ahead.

- **Week 2 – VPC Security & OSI Model in AWS:**  
  *Tasks:* Dive into AWS networking security fundamentals. Read AWS documentation on **Security Groups** and **Network ACLs** (NACLs) – focus on how SGs are stateful and attach to instances, while NACLs are stateless and operate at the subnet level. Map these to OSI layers (e.g., SGs filter at Layer 4 (TCP/UDP ports) and  Layer 3 (IP) for inbound/outbound rules). Implement experiments in your VPC: tighten the security group on the public instance to allow only your IP on SSH/HTTP and verify access is blocked from others. Add a NACL rule to deny a certain port or IP and observe the effect (using VPC Flow Logs to see dropped traffic, if possible). Enable **VPC Flow Logs** for your VPC or subnet and learn how to find log data in CloudWatch – this shows how traffic is monitored and is useful for operations.  
  *Milestone:* Understand AWS network security controls. You should be comfortable with creating and applying SG rules, NACL rules, and know how to monitor network traffic using flow logs. These skills align with security best practices needed for both the exam and real-world (part of Domain 4 on network security).

- **Week 3 – Advanced VPC Features (NAT, Endpoints & DNS):**  
  *Tasks:* Learn how instances in private subnets access the internet. Read about **NAT Gateways** vs. NAT instances in the *Amazon VPC User Guide* and why NAT Gateways are the recommended approach (managed, scalable). Update your lab VPC: add a NAT Gateway in a public subnet, update the private subnet’s route table to use it for internet-bound traffic. Test that your private EC2 can now reach the internet (e.g., `ping 8.8.8.8` or install updates). Next, study **VPC Endpoints** from AWS docs – focus on **Gateway Endpoints** (for S3, DynamoDB) and **Interface Endpoints** (AWS PrivateLink) for private connectivity to AWS services. Create a Gateway Endpoint for S3 in your VPC and test it: from the private EC2, access an S3 bucket (using AWS CLI) without a NAT Gateway – it should work through the endpoint. Also read up on how **DNS** works in VPC (Route 53 Resolver, enabling DNS hostnames). Optionally, create a **Private Hosted Zone** in Route 53 for your VPC and set up a test DNS record, ensuring your instance can resolve it.  
  *Milestone:* Capable of enabling private access to AWS services. You should know when to use a NAT Gateway vs a VPC Endpoint for access to AWS services from private subnets. Also verify you grasp the basics of DNS in AWS (critical for services like Route 53 later). This covers parts of Domain 2 (implementation) and Domain 4 (security: keeping traffic internal).

- **Week 4 – Load Balancing and High Availability:**  
  *Tasks:* Explore AWS networking services that improve availability. Read the AWS documentation on **Elastic Load Balancing** (focus on Application Load Balancer vs Network Load Balancer features). Learn how load balancers integrate with VPC (they have their own subnets, Security Groups, etc.) and how they route traffic to targets across AZs. Also skim the AWS **Well-Architected Framework** or AWS Architecture Blog for guidance on multi-AZ network designs. In your lab VPC, set up an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: launch two EC2 web servers (in two AZs if possible), and register them in an ALB target group. Test that the ALB DNS name load-balances between the servers. Note how the ALB’s security group and the instances’ security groups must allow the appropriate traffic. If time permits, explore **Auto Scaling** integration (though deep dive not needed for networking exam, understanding it helps in design questions).  
  *Milestone:* You can design a basic high-availability web architecture on AWS (multi-AZ, ALB). You’ve learned how AWS load balancers offload traffic and the differences between ALB (Layer 7) and NLB (Layer 4). This knowledge feeds into the exam Domain 1 (design for availability and performance) and gives practical skill in setting up a scalable service.

## Month 2: Expanding Networks – Multi-VPC and Hybrid Connectivity (Weeks 5–8)

**Goal:** Learn how to connect multiple VPCs and connect AWS networks with on-premises networks. By month’s end, you will handle VPC peering vs. Transit Gateway, understand AWS connectivity options (VPN, Direct Connect) and their trade-offs, and be familiar with hybrid network setups. This addresses major exam areas around design and implementation of hybrid networks.

- **Week 5 – VPC Peering & Multi-VPC Design:**  
  *Tasks:* Study **Amazon VPC connectivity options** for VPC-to-VPC communication. Read the section on **VPC Peering** in the AWS Whitepaper *“Amazon VPC Connectivity Options”* to understand how peering works (one-to-one connection, non-transitive, requires unique IP ranges, etc). Also note its limits (no transitive routing, can’t easily do centralized monitoring through it). Now implement it: create a **second VPC** in your AWS account (ensure it has a non-overlapping CIDR with your first VPC). Set up **VPC Peering** between the two VPCs (using the console or AWS CLI). Update route tables in both VPCs so that each subnet knows how to reach the other VPC via the peering connection. Launch an EC2 in the new VPC and test connectivity (ping or curl) between an instance in VPC A and VPC B. You may need to adjust security groups to allow traffic from the other VPC’s CIDR. Try a *negative test*: observe that without explicit routes or with overlapping CIDRs, peering fails or traffic won’t flow (illustrating peering’s requirements).  
  *Milestone:* Able to connect two VPCs and aware of peering limitations. You should understand that VPC Peering is suitable for simple, few-VPC use cases but doesn’t scale well for lots of VPCs or cross-account scenarios. This experience ties into exam Domain 1 & 2 (network design & implementation) as you evaluate when to use peering versus other solutions.

- **Week 6 – AWS Transit Gateway (Hub-and-Spoke Networking):**  
  *Tasks:* **AWS Transit Gateway (TGW)** is key to advanced AWS networking. Read the AWS docs or relevant whitepaper sections on Transit Gateway – focus on how it acts as a *central router* for multiple VPCs and VPNs, and its scalability (can connect **thousands of VPCs** and on-premises connections). Key points: TGW attachments (VPC, VPN, DX), TGW route tables (can isolate domains), and how TGW peering can connect regions. Compare TGW with the earlier methods: unlike peering, TGW **allows transitive routing** and simplifies multi-VPC meshes. Now get hands-on: if your AWS budget allows, create a **Transit Gateway** in your account. Attach your two existing VPCs (from Week 5) to the TGW (this may incur minimal hourly costs, so remember to delete later). Modify the VPC route tables to route inter-VPC traffic to the TGW attachment instead of the peering (or in addition). Verify connectivity between instances in different VPCs now works through the TGW (you can even delete the direct peering and see connectivity still ok via TGW). Optionally, explore TGW route tables by isolating the VPCs into different TGW routing domains and see how that affects reachability.  
  *Milestone:* Understand designing a **hub-and-spoke network** with TGW. You should be able to explain why TGW is more scalable for large architectures (central hub, up to 5,000 VPC attachments, 50 Gbps per attachment). This is crucial for the exam (Domain 1) and real-world multi-VPC environments. You’ve also practiced how to implement TGW in AWS (Domain 2 skills).

- **Week 7 – Hybrid Networking: AWS VPN Connectivity:**  
  *Tasks:* Learn how to extend networking to on-premises. Start with **AWS Site-to-Site VPN**. Read the AWS Site-to-Site VPN Developer Guide focusing on concepts: *Virtual Private Gateway (VGW)* vs *Transit Gateway* for VPN termination, *Customer Gateway* (CGW) device on the on-prem side, and routing options (static vs BGP dynamic). Note limits: AWS VPN is encrypted IPsec over the internet, with up to **1.25 Gbps** per tunnel and uses dual tunnels for high availability. Next, simulate a hybrid setup: if you have a second AWS account or can use AWS’s provided labs, set up a **VPN connection** between your TGW (or VGW on VPC) and a “simulated on-prem”. One approach: create a small EC2 instance in a different region or VPC and run a VPN software (e.g., Openswan/Strongswan) to act as the on-prem gateway. Configure an AWS Site-to-Site VPN from your AWS side (TGW or VGW) to that EC2’s public IP (acting as CGW). This is complex, so you can also use an AWS Workshop or **AWS Skill Builder lab** that guides through VPN setup if available. Once configured, test connectivity: the EC2 in your VPC should be able to reach the EC2 in “on-prem” through the VPN (ping across the tunnel). Pay attention to routing (your VPC route table needs to send on-prem IPs to the VGW/TGW, and the on-prem instance needs a route to AWS through the tunnel).  
  *Milestone:* Gain familiarity with **IPsec VPN** setup on AWS. Even if the lab was partly theoretical, you should know the steps to connect an on-prem network to AWS: create CGW resource, configure VPN connection, download config, set up on-prem device accordingly. This covers a big part of hybrid network design (Domain 1) and implementation (Domain 2). It also gives practical knowledge you’d use as an AWS network engineer setting up a corporate VPN.

- **Week 8 – Hybrid Networking: AWS Direct Connect & WAN**:  
  *Tasks:* Study **AWS Direct Connect (DX)** as an alternative to VPN. Read the *AWS Direct Connect Overview* and FAQs. Understand how DX provides a *dedicated, private fiber link* into AWS at various speeds (50 Mbps up to 100 Gbps, depending on options) and uses BGP for routing. Key points: needs a connection to a DX location, can use a **Direct Connect Gateway** to share one DX across multiple regions/VPCs, and often paired with TGW for large scale. Also be aware of the AWS SLA and reliability (for production, multiple DX links recommended, maybe in LAG or at diverse locations). Next, familiarize yourself with **AWS Cloud WAN** (a newer managed WAN service) at a high level – how it can orchestrate multi-region, multi-VPC networks across accounts. You likely won’t do a hands-on for DX (since it requires ordering a circuit) or Cloud WAN (which is advanced and may incur costs), but you can watch an AWS re:Invent video or read an AWS blog introducing Cloud WAN to understand its purpose. If available, use the *“Selecting and Designing Hybrid Connectivity”* AWS whitepaper or blog – it discusses choosing between VPN, DX, etc., which is great context for exam design questions.  
  *Milestone:* Know **when to use Direct Connect vs VPN**. For example, articulate that VPN is quick and low-cost but limited bandwidth and higher latency, whereas DX is a dedicated line suitable for stable, high-throughput needs (and they can even be combined for backup). Also have an awareness of emerging services like Cloud WAN for large enterprise networks. This wraps up the core hybrid networking content (important for Domains 1 and 2). 

  **End of Month 2 – Checkpoint:** At this stage, you’ve covered VPC basics, multi-VPC connectivity, and hybrid links. Take time to **evaluate your progress**. Revisit any topics that felt confusing (e.g., TGW routing, VPN configs) – review AWS FAQs or re-run a lab. A good idea is to attempt a few **sample exam questions** on these topics (AWS provides a free official practice question set). For example, try questions on “Given a scenario with multiple VPCs…” or “Which hybrid connectivity option…”. If you struggle, note the weak area and plan to reinforce it. Ensure you are comfortable with all acronyms (VGW, CGW, TGW, DX, etc.) and their roles. Adjust your study pace or resources if needed (for instance, use AWS re:Post to clarify doubts). Milestone: You should now be able to design a basic multi-VPC architecture with a TGW hub and propose a solution for connecting an on-prem data center to AWS (VPN vs Direct Connect). This is a major step toward both exam readiness and real-world job skills.

## Month 3: Advanced AWS Networking Services and Architectures (Weeks 9–12)

**Goal:** Deepen your expertise with advanced networking topics: global architectures, name resolution, advanced security, and network management. By end of Month 3, all exam domains should have been covered at least once. You’ll also have practiced real-world scenarios like multi-region setups, centralized security, and troubleshooting.

- **Week 9 – AWS Route 53 and Hybrid DNS:**  
  *Tasks:* Focus on DNS management in AWS, a crucial but often tricky area. Read the **Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide** sections on hosted zones (public vs private) and routing policies (simple, weighted, latency, failover, etc.). Make sure you understand how Route 53 can direct traffic based on health checks for high availability. Next, learn about **Route 53 Resolver endpoints** for hybrid DNS – this allows on-premises systems to resolve DNS names in AWS and vice versa. To reinforce: in your lab VPC, create a **Private Hosted Zone** for an internal domain (e.g., *.internal.example.com*) and create records pointing to your EC2s. Test that your EC2s can resolve these private DNS names. If you have a hybrid setup from Week 7, you could try creating a **Resolver inbound endpoint** in your VPC and configure your on-prem instance to use it for DNS, then verify it can resolve the private names (optional advanced exercise). Also experiment with Route 53 **health checks** and perhaps a simple failover record (you could create two records with failover policy, though fully testing might require two endpoints).  
  *Milestone:* Acquire the ability to design and implement DNS architectures on AWS. You should be comfortable with Route 53 for both public domains (like routing to multi-region endpoints using latency or failover policies) and private DNS (for internal service discovery in VPCs). This knowledge is directly tested on the exam (Domain 1 design scenarios) and is vital in real jobs (every cloud network uses DNS heavily).

- **Week 10 – Multi-Region Networking and Content Delivery:**  
  *Tasks:* Expand your understanding to **global AWS networking**. Learn how to connect and optimize across regions. Read about **AWS Transit Gateway inter-region peering** (allows TGWs in different regions to connect) and consider when you’d use that vs. separate connections. Also review **AWS Global Accelerator vs Amazon CloudFront** – these often confuse people. Global Accelerator provides a static anycast IP and optimizes routing to applications running in multiple regions (good for non-HTTP use cases or speeding up cross-region traffic), whereas CloudFront is a CDN caching content at Edge locations (great for web and static content). AWS has a blog or docs comparing them – make sure to note differences in use cases. For hands-on, try a basic **CloudFront** distribution: use an S3 bucket (with a sample static website or file) or one of your EC2s as an origin, and create a CloudFront distribution. Test that you can access the content via the CloudFront URL and observe the behavior (may need to open bucket permissions if using S3). If possible, also simulate Global Accelerator: you may not have multiple regions deployments to truly see it, but you can create a **Global Accelerator** in the console with your ALB as an endpoint (if AWS allows with one region – it will still give you two global anycast IPs). Test hitting those GA IPs (they should route to your ALB).  
  *Milestone:* Able to architect for **low-latency, global access**. By now, you should be able to explain how to serve a worldwide user base using AWS networking – e.g., using Route 53 latency-based routing or GA to direct users to the nearest region, and CloudFront to cache content at edge. You also grasp multi-region connectivity strategies (like linking infrastructures via TGW peering or using separate DX to each region). These are higher-level design skills (Domain 1) that also enhance your versatility as an AWS network engineer.

- **Week 11 – Advanced Network Security (WAF, AWS Network Firewall, Shield):**  
  *Tasks:* This week is about **securing AWS networks** at scale. Start with **AWS WAF** (Web Application Firewall). Read the AWS WAF developer guide overview – note that *AWS WAF lets you monitor and block HTTP(S) requests based on rules, protecting web apps from common attacks like SQL injection/XSS* ([Web Application Firewall, Web API Protection - AWS WAF](https://aws.amazon.com/waf/#:~:text=With%20AWS%20WAF%2C%20you%20can,site%20scripting%20%28XSS)). Understand how WAF is applied to CloudFront, ALB, or API Gateway. Next, learn about **AWS Shield** (Standard vs Advanced) for DDoS protection – Standard is automatic for all, Advanced is a paid service with more mitigation and visibility. Then focus on **AWS Network Firewall (NFW)**. This is a managed network firewall (layer 4 and 7, with stateful inspection and intrusion detection capabilities) that you deploy in your VPC ([AWS Network Firewall - AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-network-firewall.html#:~:text=AWS%20Network%20Firewall%20,VPC)). Read the AWS Network Firewall docs, especially the **example architectures with centralized deployment**. Key idea: you can set up a **centralized firewall VPC** and route traffic from other VPCs through it (often using Transit Gateway and dedicated subnets for inspection). Also familiarize with **AWS Firewall Manager**, which helps centrally manage WAF/NFW rules across accounts (relevant to compliance/governance). *Hands-On:* Implement a small WAF demo: go to AWS WAF in the console and create a WebACL with a simple rule (e.g., block requests from a certain IP or block a fake *bad* header). Associate the WAF WebACL with your ALB or CloudFront distribution from Week 10. Test it by making a matching request (from the blocked IP or using a header) and ensure WAF logs show it was blocked. For Network Firewall, if you have time and budget, you could try the **AWS Network Firewall Hands-on Lab** (some workshops demonstrate deploying NFW in a VPC and routing traffic through it). At minimum, draw a diagram of a **centralized egress inspection** setup: multiple spoke VPCs -> Transit Gateway -> inspection VPC with Network Firewall -> out to internet. This thought exercise will solidify how to insert NFW in path.  
  *Milestone:* Gain confidence in **securing AWS networks** beyond basic SG/NACL. You should now know what AWS WAF is and how to use it for web apps, how AWS Network Firewall can provide a managed firewall solution in VPCs ([Deployment models for AWS Network Firewall](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/deployment-models-for-aws-network-firewall/#:~:text=Deployment%20models%20for%20AWS%20Network,VPC%29%20and%2For%20North)), and how AWS Shield protects against DDoS. These services often appear in exam questions (Domain 4: Network Security) and are increasingly common in enterprise AWS environments. As a networking engineer, understanding these tools means you can design **secure** architectures (e.g., using WAF at the edge for application attacks and NFW in the core for internal traffic inspection).

- **Week 12 – Network Management & Troubleshooting:**  
  *Tasks:* This week ties together operational aspects (exam Domain 3: Network Management and Operation). Start by exploring **monitoring tools**: CloudWatch metrics (for ALB/NLB, for VPN tunnels, etc.), VPC Flow Logs (you enabled earlier) and how to filter/analyze them (perhaps use CloudWatch Insights to query flow logs for rejects or latency). Learn about **AWS CloudTrail** for auditing network changes (like who changed a route table or SG?). Also review **AWS Config** and Config Rules related to networking (e.g., there are managed rules to flag open SSH ports or unrestricted NACLs). Next, study the **AWS Reachability Analyzer**, a great tool introduced to analyze network paths. Read a tutorial on Reachability Analyzer and then use it in your environment: pick two resources (for example, one EC2 in VPC A and one in VPC B) and run an analysis to see if they can communicate. The analyzer will identify if any component (route, SG, NACL) is blocking traffic. This is excellent for troubleshooting practice. For a hands-on scenario, deliberately introduce an issue: e.g., change a NACL to block traffic from VPC B, then use Reachability Analyzer to see the identified block. Also consider setting up **CloudWatch Alarms** for certain metrics (like if a VPN goes down or high error count on an ALB) – this is how you’d operationalize network monitoring.  
  *Milestone:* You are proficient in **operating and troubleshooting AWS networks**. At this point, you know how to systematically debug connectivity (check instance OS, SG, NACL, routes, etc., using tools like Reachability Analyzer and Flow Logs). You can monitor network health and ensure compliance using AWS services. This satisfies Domain 3 of the exam and is directly reflective of job duties (an AWS network engineer must quickly find and fix network issues and set up proper monitoring).

  **End of Month 3 – Checkpoint:** You have now covered all major exam domains (Design, Implementation, Operations, Security). It’s time to do a **comprehensive review**. Consider reading the AWS whitepaper *“Building a Scalable and Secure Multi-VPC Network Infrastructure”* which ties many concepts together (multi-account VPC setups, Transit Gateway, Direct Connect, security best practices). This will reinforce best-practices in design and might introduce any concept you missed. At this point, attempt the official **AWS Practice Question Set** for Advanced Networking (if you haven’t already). Score yourself – aim for at least ~70-80% correct as a sign you’re on track. Identify which domain the wrong answers fall into and revisit those topics. If, for example, you got DNS-related questions wrong, go back to Route 53 labs; if a question on BGP routes in DX was confusing, review that. **Adjust the upcoming weeks** to focus more on weak areas. It’s better to reschedule now than to rush later. Also ensure you have an AWS account in good standing for labs (no surprise bills – clean up unused resources!). 

## Month 4: Integration Project & Deeper Skill Development (Weeks 13–16)

**Goal:** Solidify your skills with a capstone-style project and targeted practice. This month, you will design and build a more complex AWS network scenario integrating many services, practice infrastructure-as-code, and run through troubleshooting drills. By the end of Month 4, you should feel “job-ready” – able to handle real AWS networking tasks end-to-end – and be nearly ready to ace the certification exam after final practice.

- **Week 13 – Capstone Design: Multi-VPC Hybrid Architecture Design**:  
  *Tasks:* Challenge yourself with a **holistic design exercise**. Imagine a scenario (common in enterprises): e.g., *“Company ABC” has 3 VPCs (Dev, Prod, Shared Services) across different AWS accounts, needs them connected together and to an on-prem data center, with centralized egress filtering and DNS.”* Take this or a similar scenario and spend time designing a solution. Draw a network diagram with all components: e.g., use AWS Organizations (multiple accounts), a **Transit Gateway** connecting the VPCs, a **VPN connection** or **Direct Connect** for on-prem, a **centralized Network Firewall** in a hub VPC for inspection, and **Route 53 Resolver** endpoints for DNS between on-prem and AWS. This design will incorporate many elements you learned. Now, implement a scaled-down version in your AWS account (as much as 2 hours allows): you could simulate multi-account by just using multiple VPCs. For instance, create 3 VPCs (with naming to indicate roles), attach all to a TGW, set up routing so they all communicate via TGW. Choose one VPC to be the “inspection VPC” – in it, if possible, place an **AWS Network Firewall** endpoint (or simply a NAT instance as a placeholder if NFW is too costly) and route internet-bound traffic from other VPCs through this. Also set up a Route 53 Resolver outbound endpoint in the hub to forward DNS to on-prem (you can simulate on-prem DNS with an EC2 running BIND or simply assume it). The idea isn’t to build a fully working enterprise infra (which would take days), but to **go through the design and partial implementation thought process**. Write down the steps you would need for full implementation – this itself is learning.  
  *Milestone:* Produce an **architecture diagram and description** for a complex AWS network. Even if not everything is built, explaining your design choices is valuable. For example, be ready to answer: “Why use Transit Gateway and not peering?” “How do we secure inter-VPC traffic?” “How do we ensure high availability for the VPN?” If you can confidently discuss these, you’re both exam-prepared (design scenarios) and showing real-world architect skills. This exercise also reveals any integration points you’re unsure about, which you can study more. **Tip:** Compare your design with AWS best practice whitepapers – if you included the key components they recommend, you’re on the right track.

- **Week 14 – Infrastructure as Code & Automation:**  
  *Tasks:* In a real job, manual setups don’t scale – you use Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC). This week, get a taste of automating AWS networking. Start with AWS official samples: find a **CloudFormation template** for a VPC (AWS Quick Start VPC templates are great) or use the one from the AWS Networking Workshop on GitHub ([GitHub - vsr2158/aws-networking-workshop](https://github.com/vsr2158/aws-networking-workshop#:~:text=This%20Networking%20Workshop%20aims%20to,Transit%20Gateway%20with%20minimum%20downtime)). Study the template to see how VPC, subnets, routes, etc., are defined in code. Now, try writing a simple CloudFormation template yourself (or modify an existing one) to deploy a VPC with, say, 2 subnets, an Internet Gateway, and a security group. Deploy it via CloudFormation and verify it creates the resources correctly. If CloudFormation feels too heavy, consider using the AWS CLI or AWS CDK for a small task (for example, use AWS CLI to programmatically create a new Security Group and attach to an instance, to see how scripting would work). Also look into **AWS Tools for automation** like AWS Systems Manager (which can run scripts on instances – useful for automating network changes on EC2) or even simple BASH scripts with AWS CLI. The goal is not to become a CloudFormation expert in one week, but to appreciate how networking can be automated. If time permits, use the AWS Skill Builder lab environment to practice any provided lab on AWS CloudFormation or Cloud Development Kit focusing on networking.  
  *Milestone:* You have **exposure to automation** in AWS. You should be able to read and interpret an IaC template for networking and deploy it. This skill isn’t directly tested on the exam, but the exam expects you to be aware of tools to “deploy and automate AWS networking tasks”. More importantly, job-wise, this distinguishes you as someone who can operationalize networks. Even a basic CloudFormation VPC template in your portfolio is a plus.

- **Week 15 – Troubleshooting Drills:**  
  *Tasks:* This week, simulate being an AWS Networking Engineer on the job by handling common troubleshooting scenarios. Use the environments you built in previous weeks (or create small isolated scenarios) to create issues and then resolve them:  
    - **Scenario 1:** An EC2 instance can’t reach the internet. *Drill:* Launch a test instance with no public IP or missing route or without correct security group, try to connect out, then methodically find the issue. Check instance route table (is 0.0.0.0/0 present to IGW or NAT?), check if it has a public IP/NAT, check security group egress, NACL, etc. Fix the issue (e.g., attach an IGW or allocate an Elastic IP).  
    - **Scenario 2:** Two instances in different VPCs (peered or via TGW) can’t talk. *Drill:* Possibly use the setup from Week 5–6. Intentionally break something: e.g., remove the route in one VPC for the peer or remove a TGW route, or change a NACL to block. Then practice using Reachability Analyzer or Flow Logs to pinpoint the drop. Restore the missing route or rule and verify connectivity is back.  
    - **Scenario 3:** DNS issue in hybrid setup. *Drill:* If you set up a hybrid DNS, simulate a case where on-prem can’t resolve an internal AWS name. Check the Route 53 Resolver endpoints, security groups on the endpoints (they need to allow UDP/TCP 53), etc. This may be more of a thought exercise if you can’t fully simulate.  
    - **Scenario 4:** Latency or throughput issue. *Drill:* Use CloudWatch. For instance, if you have a VPN, intentionally mismatching tunnel configs could cause one tunnel down – CloudWatch would show one tunnel state down. Or generate some traffic and see if flow logs show throttling. Consider what AWS services (like CloudWatch, VPC Traffic Mirroring, or Enhanced Networking drivers) you’d use to diagnose performance problems.  
  Document each problem and resolution. This is essentially practicing the “Ops” domain under exam conditions – many exam questions give a scenario of something not working and ask what to check. Now you have a systematic approach in mind.  
  *Milestone:* You’ve **troubleshot and resolved AWS network issues** in a controlled setting. You should feel more confident that if something goes wrong in an AWS environment, you know where to look (routes, SGs, NACLs, etc.) and what tools to use. This skill is invaluable on the job, and it solidifies your understanding for the exam’s scenario questions.

- **Week 16 – Wrap-Up of Any Weak Spots / Final Adjustments:**  
  *Tasks:* Use this week to **fill any remaining gaps** in knowledge or practice. Review your notes from the past 15 weeks. For any topic you still feel unsure about, do a targeted refresh: For example, if **BGP routing priorities** in AWS Direct Connect vs VPN weren’t clear, spend time on AWS blogs or documentation that explain how AWS propagates BGP routes. If you skimmed something due to time (e.g., Cloud WAN or IPv6), decide if it’s relevant and get a basic understanding (IPv6 is increasingly important; know how to assign IPv6 to subnets and the peculiarities of e.g., IGW supporting IPv6 without NAT). Also consider revisiting the exam guide one more time – ensure every listed service or concept in the guide/appendix you can at least explain at a high level. *Hands-on:* If there’s a lab exercise you skipped before, you can do it now. For instance, if you never actually tried **IPv6 in a VPC**, now is a good time: enable an IPv6 CIDR in your VPC, assign an IPv6 address to an instance, and test connectivity (you’ll learn that security groups and NACLs need to have IPv6 rules too). This “loose ends” week is also a buffer in case earlier weeks slipped.  
  *Milestone:* All major exam blueprint topics have been covered and practiced. You have no significant fear areas – maybe some things you know theoretically but didn’t deeply practice (that’s okay given 2 hrs/week constraint, just be sure you understand the theory). You’re essentially ready to shift into exam prep mode fully. Also, on the practical side, you now have a collection of mini-projects and notes that you could discuss in a job interview or use on the job (like that CloudFormation template or the troubleshooting runbook you created).

## Month 5: Exam Preparation and Final Review (Weeks 17–20)

**Goal:** Focus on passing the AWS Certified Advanced Networking – Specialty exam. This month is about revision, practice exams, and sharpening exam-taking skills while keeping practical knowledge fresh. By the end, you’ll schedule and **pass the exam**, confident not only in theory but also in practical ability.

- **Week 17 – Exam Domain-by-Domain Review:**  
  *Tasks:* Revisit each of the four exam domains systematically, ensuring you recall the key points and AWS services in each:  
    - **Domain 1 (Network Design – 30%)**: Review hybrid network design (VPN, DX, TGW, Cloud WAN), multi-region designs, high availability patterns (HA VPN, redundant DX, multi-AZ load balancing), and edge networking (CloudFront, Route 53 routing). Make sure you can evaluate a scenario and choose the right design (this often involves comparing options). Re-read any pertinent whitepapers or AWS blog “architecture” posts for design tips.  
    - **Domain 2 (Network Implementation – 26%)**: Go over how to implement solutions: e.g., steps to set up a VPC peering vs steps to set up TGW, how to configure a Route 53 Resolver, how to set up VPC endpoints. This is more procedural – ensure you know AWS service limits and configurations (exam may ask, *“Which configurations are needed to achieve X?”*). Flip through AWS documentation or your notes for any detailed steps you might’ve forgotten (like the need to update route tables after creating a peering or that TGW Connect is used for SD-WAN integration – small details can appear).  
    - **Domain 3 (Network Management and Operation – 20%)**: Summarize the tools for monitoring (CloudWatch metrics, VPC Flow Logs), for diagnostics (Reachability Analyzer, traceroute), and for maintenance (AWS Config, AWS CloudTrail for auditing). Also recall any scenarios about network optimization (maybe questions on MTU for Jumbo frames, or using AWS Global Accelerator for improving performance).  
    - **Domain 4 (Network Security, Compliance, Governance – 24%)**: List out the security services and features: SG, NACL, WAF, Network Firewall, Shield, Firewall Manager, PrivateLink, etc., and the compliance/gov aspect like multi-account security control (SCPs or AWS Organizations, though those are more IAM oriented, but mention if network-related governance like ensuring VPCs have Flow Logs via Config rules). Make sure you know how to **secure hybrid connections** (encryption, etc.) and **secure multi-VPC** setups (isolating via TGW route tables, etc.).  
  After reviewing each domain, **self-check** by explaining key concepts out loud or writing a one-page summary for each domain. This exercise will highlight anything you can’t explain clearly (which means you need to study that more).  
  *Milestone:* Completed a full content refresh. By the end of this week, you have effectively *condensed* the last 4 months of learning into a mental checklist of AWS networking knowledge. You should feel like “Yes, I remember how to do that” for each blueprint item. If not, quickly go back to that topic’s resources.

- **Week 18 – Practice Questions and Timed Quiz:**  
  *Tasks:* This week, practice with exam-style questions to build confidence and timing. Use the **AWS Official Practice Question Set** (if you haven’t already, redo it to measure improvement). If you have access to the **Official Practice Exam** on AWS Skill Builder (which is a full-length timed exam), schedule that and take it under exam conditions (no notes, timed 170 minutes). Additionally, consider reputable third-party practice exams (Tutorials Dojo, Whizlabs, etc., if you are open to them – they can be very helpful for gauging readiness, but since you prefer official materials, stick to the official ones and perhaps AWS re:Post questions tagged with ANS-C01 for any community-discussed scenarios). After each set of practice questions, **review the explanations** thoroughly. For every question you got wrong, find the reference in AWS docs and read why the correct answer is right. For example, if you missed a question on **AWS Global Accelerator vs CloudFront**, go back and review the differences until it’s crystal clear. If you notice slow timing, practice eliminating wrong answers faster by focusing on keywords in the question (practice exams help with this technique).  
  *Milestone:* Achieve passing-level scores on practice tests. Ideally, you should be scoring ~80% or higher consistently on practice quizzes. More importantly, you *understand* why each answer is correct or incorrect – this understanding is key for the real exam. You should also get used to the exam question style (sometimes lengthy scenarios). By the end of the week, decide on an exam date (if not already scheduled) for next week or the week after, depending on your comfort.

- **Week 19 – Mock Exam and Final Prep:**  
  *Tasks:* Time for a full **mock exam**. If you haven’t taken a full-length practice exam yet, do it now (some sources offer 65-question mock exams). Simulate exam conditions strictly: quiet environment, 170 minutes timer, no interruptions. After finishing, score it and review each question’s answer. **Analyze your performance by domain**: if you did poorly in, say, Domain 4 (Security), then devote an extra hour to brush up NACL vs SG logic, Shield Advanced features, etc. This week, also compile a **“cheat sheet”** for last-minute review – not to use in exam, but to write down must-remember facts: e.g., *“Max VPN throughput 1.25 Gbps per tunnel”*, *“TGW attaches 5k VPCs”*, *“AWS BGP community tags for routes (just in case)”*, *“Order of evaluation: NACLs first then SGs”*, *“DNS resolvers .2 address in VPC”*, etc. Writing these out helps cement them. If there are any **recent updates** (services like AWS Cloud WAN or new features launched that could be relevant), quickly read the FAQs or announcements. AWS Networking evolves, and while the exam won’t have extremely new services if not in the guide, it’s good to be aware (for job context too). Finally, ensure your **exam registration** is ready, Pearson VUE online setup tested if remote, or route to test center known if in-person.  
  *Milestone:* You have taken a full practice exam and are scoring in the safe zone. Any lingering weaknesses have been addressed. You have a memory “refresh sheet” for quick day-before review. At this point, you should feel ready to take the real exam in the next few days. 

- **Week 20 – Final Review and Exam Day:**  
  *Tasks:* In the days leading up to the exam, do a light review – do not cram last-minute new information, instead revisit your notes, diagrams, and the cheat sheet you made. Especially go over your **architecture diagrams** or lab screenshots from your hands-on work; visual memory of how you set up things can help answer scenario questions. Get a good night’s sleep before the exam. On exam day, **calmly recall** that you’ve not only studied but also *practiced* these concepts – this will help you reason through tricky questions. When taking the exam, manage your time (65 questions in 170 minutes ~ 2.6 minutes per question; some will be quicker, some longer case studies). Mark questions you’re unsure about and come back if time allows. Use the elimination tactics you honed in practice. After the exam, no matter the result, reflect on your preparation journey. Given your thorough hands-on practice and study, you’re very likely to **pass the exam** and earn the certification.  
  *Milestone:* **Certification achieved!** 🎉 Plus, you’ve gained real-world skills along the way. To leverage those job-ready skills: consider creating a small portfolio or write-up of what you built (for instance, a blog about your multi-VPC setup or a diagram of a reference architecture). This can be useful to demonstrate your expertise to employers. Continue practicing and learning (networking is a vast field), but your structured plan and discipline have paid off.

## Post-Plan: Continuous Learning and Next Steps

Congratulations on completing the plan! Passing the Advanced Networking – Specialty exam validates your knowledge in designing, implementing, and securing AWS networks at scal】. More importantly, the hands-on labs and scenarios have given you confidence to perform as an AWS Networking Engineer in real environments. Continue to **build on this foundation**: maybe contribute to AWS forums, attempt AWS Networking quests on Skill Builder, or even pursue another related certification (Security or Solutions Architect) to round out your profile. Always keep an eye on AWS updates (networking services evolve with new features like AWS Cloud WAN, new Gateway Load Balancer capabilities, etc.). With your strong base, you can pick those up quickly. Good luck on your exam and your AWS networking career journey!
